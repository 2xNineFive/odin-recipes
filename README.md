# odin-recipes
Create recipe project from The Odin Project

The purpose of this repo is to create a simple web page that displays a collection of recipes. Skills I am practicing for this project include: using the terminal, using Git and Github and creating project directories. My IDE is VS Code. 

On a personal note, I like the brutalist web design aesthetic and am enticed to move in that direction for this project.
